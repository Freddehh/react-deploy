We have created a website which allows the user to look up information from the game League of Legends,
by searching on a username which will yield some information about that palyer.
To accomplish this we have used Riot API. (We have not yet gotten any development keys, so the API-key needs
to be refreshed every 24hours)

To build the site we chose React over Angular and Vue, because of our research which implied that 
React is the most popular framework. In Stack Overflow's 2020 developer research, React made it to second place 
after regular J-query of what most people use. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks-all-respondents2 
Another reason to why we choose React is that there's a large community of developers that are making React better as itâ€™s an open-source library and coders from around the world are helping people learn the technology in different ways. https://brainhub.eu/blog/reasons-to-choose-react-for-frontend-development/ 
Also, if you search with Google for the different libraries followed by "tutorial", React has the most hits by far.
