We have created a website which allows the user to look up information from the game League of Legends,
by searching on a username which will yield some information about that palyer.
To accomplish this we have used Riot API. (We have not yet gotten any development keys, so the API-key needs
to be refreshed every 24hours)

To build the site we chose React over Angular and Vue, because of our research which implied that 
React is the most popular framework. In Stack Overflow's 2020 developer research, React made it to second place 
after regular J-query of what most people use. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks-all-respondents2 
Because of this it was easy for us to find lots of documentation and find answers online. 

Before you can run our program, you need to run 2 'npm install'

2: npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

To start the program, run 'npm start'
